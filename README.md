## 🤔 What is MERN Stack?

The **MERN Stack** is a powerful set of technologies used for building modern web applications. It’s a full-stack JavaScript solution that includes:

### 1. **MongoDB**  
A NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format, making it flexible and scalable for modern web apps.

### 2. **Express.js**  
A lightweight framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of server-side applications and API routing.

### 3. **React.js**  
A frontend JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React is known for its speed and modular component-based structure.

### 4. **Node.js**  
A JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.
